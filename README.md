# Gadget2_modwith4
## Introduction
This project is an attempt to port the gas cooling module from gadget-4 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03567) to gadget-2 (https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0505010).

The motivation for this attempt was to use the sidm module that someone else had already implemented in Gadget-2, which was temporarily difficult to port to Gadget-4.

## Compilation and Installation
